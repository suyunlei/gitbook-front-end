# ShallowCopy and DeepCopy of Objects
**Shallow Copy**: Cursor just points to the memory address being copied. And if the value of original address changes, then the shallow copy of the resulting object will change accordingly.
**Deep Copy**: Create a new memory address in the computer to hold the copied objects.
